# Matrixio

## User Story

Online templates used for tracking speech and learning
exercises are really hard to find. The Matrixio team has developed an application that allows users, of any field, to build alterable learning matrices for each of their students unique needs. Matrixio will save each students learning matrices in a database that is retreivable for future reference upon log in.

## Usage

To use Matrixio, simply create an account from the sign up page. After signing up the user will be redirected to the login page. Once logged in users will be taken to their profile page where they can begin adding students and building matrices. If the user no longer wishes to have an account or needs to make updates to their existing account, the Settings page houses a delete account option and update account forms.

Sign up, log in, and get to work creating your own matrices!
